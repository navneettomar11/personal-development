# Preface
# Having it all

Have you ever admired those successful people who seem to have it all? You see them chatting confidently at business meetings, comfortably at social parties. They're the one with the best jobs, the nicest spouse, the coolest friends, the biggest accounts, the most fashionable postcodes.

*But wait a minute!* A lot of them aren't cleverer than you. They're not more educated than you. They're not even better looking! So what is it? (Some people suspect they inherited it. Other say they married it, or were just plain lucky. Tell them to think again.) What it boil down to is their more skilful way of dealing with fellow human being.

You see, nobody gets to the top alone. Over the years, people who seem to 'have it all' have captured the hearts and conquered the mind of hundreds of other who helped boost them rung by rung, to the top of whatever corporate or social ladder they chose.

Wannabes wandering around at the foot of the ladder often gaze up and complain that the Big Boys and Big Girls at the top are snobs. When Big Players don't give them their friendship, love, or business they call them 'cliquish' or accuse them of belonging to an 'old-boy-network'. Some grumble they hit their heads against s 'glass ceiling'.
